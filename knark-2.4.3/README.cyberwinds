This package includes some sample 2.4 module codes and Knark.59 ported
to kernel 2.4. I feel it is really nasty not to provide any protection
module against knark in such kind of distribution, so in the
knark-2.4.3 directory, you can find a syscall module. This syscall
module can take a snapshot of all the syscall addresses in current
system. By doing so, you can create a syscall addresses copy after a
refresh installation and use this copy to validate your system
integrity later on.

If you do not know what knark is, you probably won't want to try it out.

What's new?

1. 2.4 kernel support
   *) The /proc filesystem stuff has to be completely rewritten
because of kernel migration from 2.2 to 2.4. /proc node registration
and cleanup code is completely different. There is no longer shortcut
to identify /proc/net/tcp and /proc/net/udp--that were statistically
set in 2.2 kernel.
   *) The 2.4 kernel uses getdents64 to identify a dentry. As a
   *) diff knark.c.2.2 knark.c will show all the changes made to the
module to work on kernel 2.4
result, sys_getdents64 has to be intercepted and new data structures
are introduced.
2. modhide can hide arbitrary module.
   *) By using module->modname, arbitrary module can be hidden from
examination.
